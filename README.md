# Commonplace Book

## What?
A robust, searchable digital repository for the ideas, quotes and maxims that strike you as you go about your life, wherever they come from.

Quickly capture, categorise, and tag passages from books, articles, essays, or your own imagination.

Search your commonplace book by category, tags, author, source, and/or date, to find the perfect entry to inspire an essay, speech, article, or your personal philosophy.

Build a reference of ideas that matter most to you - captured in a way that makes sense to you.

##
## Why?
We consume more information than ever, but so much of it immediately slips through our fingertips and out of our minds.

Capturing and cataloguing ideas that strike you at a moment in time will make it more likely that you can hold on to and refer back to those ideas in the future - whether for your own reflection when facing particular challenges or opportunities, or to weave into your writing and speaking.

The act of reflecting on which ideas are important to you and what they are about helps you to connect ideas and develop your thinking.

Many digital solutions for capturing notes exist (e.g. Evernote, Day One, OneNote), but they lack detailed cataloguing and searching power, tending to be limited to tags and broad text searches.

The Commonplace Book app is tailored specifically to easily capturing and comprehensively searching entries, with a user interface and presentation designed to exactly match its purpose of storing and recalling ideas and who and where they came from.
